    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). "

    "# Answer:\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data)."

    "2. Object\n",
    "3. Attribute\n",
    "4. Behavior\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    "1. Class: A class is a definition of objects of the same kind. In other words, a class is a blueprint, template, or prototype that defines and describes the static attributes and dynamic behaviors common to all objects of the same kind.\n",
    "2. Objects: are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. In between, each object is made into a generic class of object and even more generic classes are defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in their code.\n",
    "3. Attribute denotes a part of an aggregate object, and so is used during analysis as well as design to express a singular property of the class.\n",
    "4. The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure."
